    <h2>reading books</h2>
    
    <h3>Books are my best friend and companion.They are interesting and fascinating, I like the Harry Potter series.I love books because reading books drive out stress and they can be knowledgeable.When you read books you keep reading it and you don't even realize that so many hours have passed.Its like being stuck in the book.Harry Potter book is one of them,we even like to read books because of various subjects we want to learn.So in my opinion we should read books as a good book is worth more than hundred bad friends.</h3>
